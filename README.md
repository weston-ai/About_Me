### My scientific background is influenced by a years of experience in the wet lab and the dry lab. I enjoy developing causal inferential pipelines for clinical, cohort, and cross-sectional analysis in epidemiology, and I'm very skilled at utilizing metabolomics and transcriptomics data to model biological processes in animals/humans. More recently, I've become familiar with the structuring of artificial neural networks (i.e. multilayer perceptrons and RNNs) for deep learning analysis in epidemiology and physiology. I leverage Python and Rstudio as a computing framework in Linux, and I tie this into a postgreSQL database backend.
